# CoA gameplay tests

Execute repeatable scenarios inside a real worldserver, using its loaded DBCs, SQL, scripts, maps and updates.
The runtime component is `modules/mod-ascension-compat/src/CoAGameplayTest.cpp`; it is disabled by default.

## Run

Windows, Python 3.11+, MySQL 8 client tools, a local MySQL server and a worldserver built with the runtime component
are required. Follow the repository's build authorization rules. Adding the new source requires CMake
reconfiguration before building; running an older binary will fail the readiness check.
The module requires Boost.PropertyTree headers. Component-based vcpkg installations need
`boost-property-tree` for the same triplet as the existing Boost libraries. CMake checks this dependency.

```powershell
python apps/coa-gameplay-test/run.py validate apps/coa-gameplay-test/scenarios/frostbolt.json

python apps/coa-gameplay-test/run.py run apps/coa-gameplay-test/scenarios/frostbolt.json `
  --worldserver C:/path/to/test-build/worldserver.exe `
  --config C:/path/to/worldserver.conf `
  --mysql C:/path/to/mysql.exe `
  --mysqldump C:/path/to/mysqldump.exe
```

The runner creates fresh `coa_test_<run-id>_auth` and `coa_test_<run-id>_characters` schemas on each run.
It creates a reusable `coa_test_<cache-id>_world` copy on the first run, then reuses that world database.
The copies include world data, auth/character schemas, RBAC, realm definitions, active arena season and
migration metadata.
Existing accounts and characters are not copied. The MySQL user needs read access to the sources and permission
to create/import/drop the test schemas. Sources must be local. No authserver or game client is needed.
The copies omit MySQL triggers, routines and scheduled events.

If the normal server account cannot create schemas, pass `--database-client-config <admin-client.ini>`.
The existing MySQL `[client]` file must provide `host`, `port`, `user` and `password`, with the same host/port
as all source connections. Its credentials are used for cloning, the isolated server and cleanup. For the
local Repack, this file is `C:/Ascension/CoA-Repack/mysql/admin-client.ini`. Credentials stay in temporary
config files, never command arguments or reports; no grants or existing accounts are changed.

The generated config binds the test worldserver to loopback on an unused port, uses a private log directory,
disables map worker threads and points all three database connections to isolated schemas. Source SQL updates
run normally against the copies. Source configuration and the installed server are not changed. Relative
`DataDir` is resolved against the binary's directory; use an absolute path when that differs from your setup.
Module `.conf` files beside the source config (in `modules/`) are copied into the test directory's
`configs/modules/` location used by the Windows server, then removed at the end. Their hashes appear in the
summary. Use `--modules-config-dir` for a different source location. Module configs cannot override database
isolation or harness controls. Other platforms require adapting module configuration discovery.

When the scenario ends, the runtime logs out its test players and shuts down. The runner waits for process
exit before dropping the auth/character schemas, auditing the cached world and removing generated credentials.
Startup, scenario, shutdown and copy operations have timeouts. An interrupted run performs the same cleanup;
a hard termination may leave the named schemas and cache lease behind. Inspect `summary.json` and the lease
before removing any leftovers.

## Reusing the world database

Reuse is the default. Each run still starts a new worldserver and fresh accounts/characters, so inventory,
talents, quests and other character state cannot carry over. The cache saves the full world import on later runs.
Metadata lives under `.cache/coa-gameplay-tests/world-cache/`; `--world-cache-dir` selects a different directory.
This directory contains ownership metadata and an exclusive lease, not credentials or SQL dumps.

Add one of these options to the same `run` command when needed:

- `--refresh-world`: replace the owned world copy before running, then retain it if the scenario leaves it clean.
- `--fresh-databases`: bypass the cache, copy all three schemas and drop them after the run. Use this for final
  verification when a completely fresh database is required. It also works with older harness binaries.

The runner checks source table contents and definitions, repository SQL files under `data/sql/updates`,
`data/sql/custom` and `modules`, and the source/main module configs. Changes refresh the cache automatically.
Source SQL stored elsewhere needs an explicit `--refresh-world`. C++ edits and a new binary alone do not force
a full copy. Cache ownership also includes the MySQL server identity, host, port and source world schema.

Startup migrations run before the native startup barrier. The runner records the world state at that barrier,
then releases character loading and scenario actions. After shutdown it compares the world again. Persistent
world writes, including console edits, discard that copy. A failed gameplay assertion can still leave a clean,
reusable world. Auth/character databases are always discarded after the owned server stops.

Content checks use MySQL `CHECKSUM TABLE ... EXTENDED` and table definitions. They still scan the data and can
briefly block writes to a table while it is read; reuse skips copying/importing rather than all database work.
Checksums can collide, so reuse is a regression-testing optimization, not a proof of byte-for-byte equality.
See the [MySQL checksum documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/checksum-table.html).
World views, stored triggers/routines/events or unavailable checksums require `--fresh-databases`.
Avoid changing source data during a run.

Only one run can lease a given cache. A second run fails before using it; `--fresh-databases` allows an independent
concurrent run. A hard interruption or an unkillable server keeps the lease blocked. Check the lease's runner PID
and result directory and verify that its worldserver has exited before recovering it; never delete a lease to
override a running test. Refresh does not bypass a lease or an ownership mismatch.

`summary.json` records `world_cache.mode` (`created`, `reused`, `refreshed` or `fresh`), the retained world schema,
invalidation reason, and preparation/server/total seconds. A retained world with `retained: true` is intentional.
Generated credential and module configuration files are removed on every normal cleanup.

Results default to `.cache/coa-gameplay-tests/<run-id>/`:

- `scenario.json`: exact scenario used.
- `worldserver.log`: process output, including startup and script errors.
- `result.json`: server version, actual values and step outcomes.
- `summary.json`: overall result, binary/scenario SHA-256 and any cleanup failure.

Exit code zero requires every expected assertion and step to complete, matching run identity, a clean server
exit and successful cleanup/cache audit. A submitted cast alone is never a pass. Numeric fields in the server's
property-tree JSON are strings; the Python runner converts and rechecks assertion values.

## Scenario format

Start from [scenarios/frostbolt.json](scenarios/frostbolt.json). Schema version 1 accepts up to eight players,
eight creatures and 10,000 sequential steps. Optional `timeout_ms` bounds setup plus execution (default 90s,
maximum 10 minutes). Optional `contract` records the independently established expected behavior.
The [talent and item scenario](scenarios/talent-and-items.json) exercises talent learning, passive removal,
equipping a shirt and consuming a healing potion. It does not measure the talent's damage coefficient.
The [Shadowblast scenario](scenarios/shadowblast-shadow-rage.json) reproduces a Shadow Rage pet-targeting crash
and checks the buff's recipient, with ordinary Frostbolt casts as a control.
The [Shadow Effigy scenario](scenarios/shadow-effigy.json) checks combat casts, one active effigy per owner,
nearby-enemy debuffs, replacement by another effigy and timed despawn.
The [Dusk Blade scenario](scenarios/dusk-blade.json) checks dual-wield damage, Rage spending and healing
the wounded caster across repeated melee casts.
The [resource talents scenario](scenarios/resource-talents.json) checks the live-tree 1% resource bonuses.
Arm of Thorim rolls 133–144 base damage at the fixture level, so two independent rolls need ratio ranges
of 1.10–1.31 with its 20% bonus and 0.91–1.09 without it (including integer rounding). Charged Conduit
preserves Static and must leave the talent without a depletion bonus.

Players require `id`, numeric `race` and `class`; `level` defaults to 80. Optional `spell_hit_rating`,
`spell_crit_rating`, `ranged_hit_rating`, `melee_hit_rating` and `expertise_rating` add fixture ratings through
normal calculations, useful for preventing misses, dodges and parries in deterministic tests.
Characters are created and loaded through the existing character creation, enumeration and login
handlers with ordinary player security. Optional `location` supplies `map`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `o` for a fixture
teleport. `location.ignore_access` optionally bypasses entry requirements for a fixture (for example a solo
raid test), without enabling GM mode during combat. Actors share phase `1 << 30` to isolate ordinary spawns.

Creatures require `id`, player `owner` and template `entry`. Optional `distance` offsets X from their owner
(default 3 yards); `faction`, `level`, `health` default to 14, 80, 100000. They retain template data and AI,
with passive reaction and health regeneration disabled. Pick a template whose scripts suit the experiment.
Setup clears combat initiated by spawn-time AI before starting the scenario. Later combat follows normal rules.
Creature AI and local level scaling can still change initial fixture levels and maximum health. Let them settle
before taking baselines; assert stable maximums and final levels when testing damage coefficients.

| Action | Fields and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `console` | `command`: execute one console command on the test server; capture its output. |
| `command` | `actor`, `command` beginning with `.`: execute with the player's normal permissions. |
| `learn`, `unlearn` | `actor`, `spell`: configure learned spells/passives through player APIs. |
| `set_aura` | `actor`, `spell`, `stacks`: fixture aura state, within its stack limit; zero removes it. |
| `talent` | `actor`, `talent`, zero-based `rank`: learn with normal point/prerequisite checks. |
| `reset_talents` | `actor`: reset active talents through normal removal, without a trainer fee. |
| `cast` | `actor`, `spell`, optional `target` (self by default): normal session cast handler. |
| `attack` | `actor`, `target`: native melee attack request; verify combat or damage with assertions. |
| `cast_charm` | Same fields: native pet-cast handler, with the charmed unit as the default target. |
| `gossip_hello` | `actor`, optional `target`: native gossip handler; defaults to the actor's summoned companion. |
| `gossip_select` | `actor`, zero-based `option`: select from the current menu through the session handler. |
| `who` | `actor`, optional name-filter `target`, `class_mask`, `race_mask`: submit a native Who query. |
| `add_item` | `actor`, `item`, optional `count` (default 1): grant fixture inventory. |
| `equip` | `actor`, `item`, `slot` (0..18): equip an owned item through the session handler. |
| `use_item` | `actor`, `item`, `spell`, optional `target`: normal item-use handler. |
| `set_level` | `actor`, `value` (1..80): fixture level change through native `GiveLevel`, including level-change hooks. |
| `set_health`, `set_power` | `actor`, `value` within native maximums; `set_power` accepts `power` (default 0). |
| `wait` | `ms`: let the real world continue updating. |
| `snapshot` | `actor`, `metric`, `save_as`: remember a numeric observation. |
| `assert` | `actor`, `metric`, `equals` and/or `min`/`max`: check an observation. |

Every step accepts a descriptive `label`. Assertions optionally accept `within_ms`: poll until the expected
state appears, failing at the deadline. This means "eventually", not "remains true throughout the window".
Equipment changes obey combat restrictions. Prepare gear before starting combat, including combat caused
by other nearby fixture actors. Rejected equipment actions include native inventory error codes in the result.
For absence checks, wait through the relevant cast/proc window first, then assert. `relative_to` subtracts
a previously named snapshot of the same metric; it is available on snapshots and assertions.
`ratio_to` then divides by a nonzero snapshot of the same metric, for comparisons such as boosted/base damage.
`cast` accepts an optional `destination` with `x`, `y`, `z` to send an explicit ground target.

Metrics: `health`, `max_health`, `power`, `max_power`, `alive`, `combat`, `casting`, `level`, `knows_spell`,
`has_talent`, `talent_points`, `cooldown_ms`, `item_count`, `bank_bag_slots`, `aura`, `aura_stacks`, `aura_charges`,
`aura_duration_ms`, `aura_amount`, `pet_entry`, `pet_aura_stacks`, `owned_creature_count`,
`charm_entry`, `charm_aura_stacks`, `controls_self`, `private_instance`, `dynamic_object`,
`dynamic_object_duration_ms`.
Boolean metrics use 0/1. Spell/aura metrics require `spell`; `item_count` requires `item`.
`aura_positive` reads the applied aura's beneficial flag; check `aura` separately to distinguish absence from a debuff.
`gossip_options` counts the player's current server-side gossip options; it does not verify client rendering.
`who_count` counts players in the actor's last native Who response; `who_class` requires a player `target`
and returns that player's class ID, or zero if absent. These inspect packets from socketless test sessions,
not client packet delivery. Masks use native Who bits (`1 << classID`, `1 << raceID`), with class 32 in bit zero;
omitted masks mean all. The custom-class scenario expects ordinary player RBAC, including faction separation.
`health_pct` observes current health as a percentage of maximum health.
`cast_speed_multiplier` observes the native cast-time multiplier; smaller values mean faster casts.
`spell_crit_chance` observes the player's Shadow spell critical chance, in percentage points.
`spell_damage_done` and `melee_damage_done` require `target` and query native outgoing damage calculations
with a fixed base of 1000. The spell metric also requires `spell` and accepts `effect` (default 0); the melee metric uses a main-hand white hit.
`spell_damage_taken` and `melee_damage_taken` query the corresponding incoming bonus calculations;
`target` identifies the attacker. These queries do not execute attacks or include hit rolls, critical hits,
armor/resistance mitigation, or proc effects.
`spell_power_cost` requires `spell` and queries its current native resource cost; it does not submit a cast.
`open_item` takes `actor` and `item` and submits the native container-open packet. `close_loot` takes `actor`
and closes its current loot window. `collect_loot` takes `actor`, collects slot zero, verifies that its full rolled
quantity reached inventory and records the item/count. It supports ordinary container loot, not quest-only slots.
`loot_count` and `loot_entry` report the actor's current uncollected item slots and first entry; `loot_received`
reports the inventory increase from its last successful `collect_loot`. Closed windows return zero slots/entry.
`quest_rewarded` requires `quest` and reads the player's native rewarded status.
`prepare_quest` takes `actor` and `quest`, adds the quest and required delivery items, then completes its objectives
as fixture setup. `reward_quest` takes the same fields and optional zero-based `choice` (default 0); it checks normal
reward eligibility and invokes native reward delivery. These actions do not test quest-giver interaction or objectives.
`restore_quest_spells` takes `actor` and invokes the native restoration of spells from rewarded quests.
`login_hooks` takes `actor` and replays registered player-login hooks on the current character; it does not reconnect
or reload the character from the database. Use it to exercise a repair against deliberately seeded fixture state.
`has_talent` requires the talent rank's spell ID; passive talents are separate from the learned spellbook.
`talent_points` measures unspent points in the active specialization.
`bank_bag_slots` measures the player's unlocked standard bank bag slots (0..7).
`pet_entry` measures the player's current guardian pet entry, or zero if absent. `pet_aura_stacks`
requires `spell`, accepts `caster` for aura ownership, and returns zero if the pet or aura is absent.
`charm_entry` and `charm_aura_stacks` observe the player's charmed unit in the same way.
`controls_self` checks that the player's movement controller is their own character.
`private_instance` checks membership in a scripted private map such as Manastorm.
`dynamic_object` checks for the player's ground effect with the specified `spell`.
`dynamic_object_duration_ms` measures its remaining duration, or zero when absent.
Player commands retain normal permission and gameplay checks; verify their effects with assertions.
`owned_creature_count` requires a player and `entry`. It counts living creatures of that entry owned by
the player, in the same phase and within 100 yards, including summons outside the guardian-pet slot.
An optional `spell` restricts the count to creatures with that aura; `caster` can select its aura owner.
`power`/`max_power` accept a numeric `power` (0..6). Aura metrics optionally accept `caster` to select
ownership; `aura_amount` also accepts an effect index (0..2, default 0). Missing auras yield zero;
check aura presence separately when zero is a valid effect amount. Permanent aura duration is -1.

## Effective spell report

The server console command `coa spellreport <file>` (console only) writes a read-only JSON report of the spells
custom classes can obtain and the spells they reach. `AscensionCompat.SpellReport.StartupFile` writes the same
report once at startup. It reads the loaded server state: SpellInfo after corrections and module contracts,
`spell_proc`, `spell_bonus_data`, `spell_linked_spell` and `spell_script_names`.

- Roots: module grant tables (class spells, live baseline spells/proficiencies, CoA talent and automatic entries,
  progression ranks, taught abilities, talent replacements), racial and class skill lines, player-create spells,
  DBC talents and `SPELL_EFFECT_LEARN_SPELL` targets. Each root records its sources. `grant` is false when only
  skill lines provide the spell.
- Closure, up to six edges: effective `TriggerSpell`; `MiscValue` spell ids on effects 164-198 and auras 317-366;
  and positive `spell_linked_spell` runtime lookups. Raw DBC trigger/misc edges that a correction changed are also
  followed. Spells reachable only through them are marked `"effective": false` and excluded from the counts.
- Per spell and slot: effective values, and under `raw` the Spell.dbc values that differ. Also included: effect and
  aura handler kinds (`handler`, `null`, `unused`, `no_immediate`, `missing` for a null table entry,
  `out_of_range`), trigger-aura type, `spell_proc` entry, bonus data, bound scripts, rank chain, linked spells and
  the roots that reach it.
- Summary counts for all closure spells and for the `grant` scope: silent slots by primitive, dummy slots without
  script bindings, proc auras (42/43/231) without proc data, rewrites and masking patterns, spellmod ops of 32 or
  more, and aura 112 private selectors 20000-20017.

C++ `CastSpell` literals, summon AI casts, global script hooks and core id switches are not visible to the report.
The [effective spell report scenario](scenarios/effective-spell-report.json) writes two reports into the run
directory. Validate them with:

```powershell
python apps/coa-gameplay-test/spell_report.py <run-dir>/effective-spell-report.json `
  --same-as <run-dir>/effective-spell-report-repeat.json --dbc <DataDir>/dbc/Spell.dbc --source-root . `
  --expect-root 801576:class_spell --expect-root 500059:class_skill_line --expect-root 804057:coa_talent
```

The validator checks the schema and references, then recomputes every summary count from the spell rows. It also
checks raw values against Spell.dbc and dispatch kinds against the handler tables in the source. It prints the
summary. Spells found only in `spell_dbc` rows are counted, not compared.

## Evidence boundaries

The test owns socketless sessions outside the network session manager. Map updates and normal spell/item
handlers execute; character database loading and login hooks execute. Authentication, transport encryption,
network session discovery, actual client packets, rendering, tooltips and UI input are outside this mode's
coverage. Transfers receive synthetic client acknowledgements. Movement/navigation, reconnect and restart
scenarios need additional driver support.

Health and power observations are net state changes. They include regeneration, absorbs, intervening procs
and other effects; they are not per-spell combat-log measurements. Control fixture conditions and use expected
ranges where appropriate. The bundled Frostbolt scenario tests behavior, not exact damage coefficients.
Random proc-rate claims require enough independent trials and a statistical assertion; this version does
not provide an automatic statistical test. Keep intended values independent of the implementation under test.

## Runner checks

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s apps/coa-gameplay-test -p 'test_*.py'
python apps/codestyle/codestyle-cpp.py --files modules/mod-ascension-compat/src/CoAGameplayTest.cpp
```

Runner checks cover invalid scenarios, incorrect/partial results, owned-process timeouts, isolation,
partial-clone cleanup, cache reuse/invalidation, ownership and exclusive leases. They do not substitute for
building and running the native scenario.
